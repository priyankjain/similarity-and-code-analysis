4. My project will be a website where it shows users where the cheap and fresh vegetables are. The website shows the time of the day it is. It has a calendar that automatically updates. There are two links. The first link goes to the map which shows the farmers market in the Greater Lafayette Area. If you click on the markers you will find information about the times they're open. There's also a widget that shows the weather currently. The other link brings the user into the annual climate of Lafayette. This include the total precipitation, average temperature, and other important aspects related to agriculture.
 5. This entire project will be coded with Javascript with HTML and CSS.
