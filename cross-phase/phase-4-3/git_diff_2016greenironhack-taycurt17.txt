-- I have been trying many different things to implement the data sets, but I cannot seem to find the right way to do it yet. I have added several markers of local markets, but I cannot seem to figure out how to make the click function on them work to show the name. I also added a temporary weather prediction in the side panel, I hope to soon have that be accurate.
+- I tried long and hard to figure out how to use the dataset, yet I could not figure it out. I think it would be prudent to do this hackathon in teams, so I could have colaborated with others and asked for their help. I searched online to learn the basics of .html and javaScript. Since this is my first time working with these languages, I think that I did a good job for myself. I feel accomplished in the fact that I leanred how to make a basic homepage and google map.
