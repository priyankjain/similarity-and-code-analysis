2. Description of the datasets and function design: I could not figure out how to implement the datasets required. 
 
 3. Brief Description
 
 Data Visualization:
 
 [N] [describe] Use Graph? What is the type? (bar chart, pie chart, radar chart ...)
I have a weather gauge in the side bar of my map that shows the current weather in West Lafayette.
 
 [N] [List] Any interaction available on the graph? List them (enable click on numbers, drag on lines, change time/variables ...)
No, but you can see the weather and move around the map.
 
 [Y] [List] Any information output? list them. (text field, text area, label, plain HTML ...)
 I currently have a homepage with a title, description, and a button that takes the user to the map view.
 
 [Y] [List] Any operation option (filters)? List them. (search markets, search vegetables, filter based on price, sort based on convenience ...)
I do not have any search options.
 
 [Y/N] [List] Any information input? List them. (comments, markers, user preference ...)
No
 
 [Y] [List] Interaction with Map? List them. (filter on price will affect map markers, sort on price will affect map markers, ...)
Right now the user can move around the map. Also, the markers are animated so they drop onto the screen and bounce when they land.
 
 [N] [List] Interaction with data visualization? List them. (filter, sort, set variables ...)
 Not yet.
 
 3. Build Case How can we build and access your project on a Linux/Unix machine if you use external dependencies besides HTML/CSS/Javascript? List the dependencies you used, such as python, node.js, etc. List the steps we should follow to build the project. Your project will be built on Amazon Web Service, EC2, ubuntu 14.01 instance
 
Run the cover.html and then click the "search" button.
 You can simply run my .html files
 
 
 None so far
 
 Additional information You Want to Share with Us E.g. any problems you faced/fixed, where you reached out to for help, etc.
- I tried long and hard to figure out how to use the dataset, yet I could not figure it out. I think it would be prudent to do this hackathon in teams, so I could have colaborated with others and asked for their help. I searched online to learn the basics of .html and javaScript. Since this is my first time working with these languages, I think that I did a good job for myself. I feel accomplished in the fact that I leanred how to make a basic homepage and google map.
