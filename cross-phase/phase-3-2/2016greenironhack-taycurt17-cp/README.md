- I have been trying many different things to implement the data sets, but I cannot seem to find the right way to do it yet. I have added several markers of local markets, but I cannot seem to figure out how to make the click function on them work to show the name. I also added a temporary weather prediction in the side panel, I hope to soon have that be accurate.
