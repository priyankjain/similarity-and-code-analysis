 
     1.Name of the application - CityFresh
 
    2.Keywords: Fresh produce, cheap local produce, near neighborhood
 
     3.Datasets and function design
 
     a.  Climate Data Online [http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/climate-data-online-cdo] in json or csv format. 
    b.  YES, the primary dataset “online climate data” is from data.gov.
    c.  YES, all these datasets are coming from data.gov.
 
 
    4.Brief Description:
 
 This application is designed to help residents of an area to buy seasonal vegetables from the local markets at a reasonably     inexpensive price. The variance in the price of fresh food products is largely determined by the climate in that area. A conducive weather involves a larger produce and less transportation costs to the markets from the field. On the other hand, a bad climate can mean lesser produce with higher transportation costs. I have tried to extract climate data from local government sites which gives an idea about the climate of a particular place. Then using this data, the application finds the places where a particular seasonal produce is cheaper than other places nearby thereby enabling the consumers to buy fresh produce at a comparatively lower rate.
 
 
 o Map View:
 
    a.	Basic Map with specific location (map is located in a meaningful place (for example Chicago)) - YES
    b.	Markers for location of markets - YES
    c.	Labels for markets' names - YES
    d.	InfoWindow to show detail information of a market - YES
    e.	Any other cover on the map (for example, cloud cover to show the weather effect) - NO (to be considered as an enhancement) 
 
 o Data Visualization:
 
    a.	YES, I will use graphs like bar chart or pie chart to show comparison among categories and to illustrate numerical proportion. 
    b.	Interaction available on the graph - NO (to be considered as an enhancement)
 
 o Interaction Form:
 
    a.	Information output will be in text field, text area, label, plain HTML - YES.
    b.	Operation option (filters) would be search markets, search vegetables, filter based on price - YES.
    c.	Information input - comments, user preference - YES (as an enhancement).
    d.	Interaction with Map- filter on price will affect map markers, sort on price will affect map markers - YES.
    e.	Interaction with data visualization – filter like time and place- YES.
 
     5. Build Case - I have initially started with HTML and Javascript and might consider using other technologies as I proceed.
