 Currently developed an initial tableau viz using the food almanac data set from Data.Gov. I am also currently on working on implementing the weather data set but do not plan on using it as much as other data sources. I am also developing a tool to crawl the twitterAPI in order to search every zipcode in indiana for specific results in order to determine where people are talking about fresh farm grown vegtables. I am starting the crawler later tonight and saving the data in a sqlite db, I was wondering if there was an instance I could also use for this project? The schema of the table is included as well.


UPDATE PHASE 3:

I have finished my data puller from twitter, it has completed one complete pull and has started its second to pull twitter data for two days. After this I will input into tableau to create the final viz. I got the OK at the very begining of the project ot use Tableau as long as it works web based so I am not sure why I am recieving low marks for using it. example data should be included in this submission as well.....
