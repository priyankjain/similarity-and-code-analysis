 3. Brief Description
With Cheapest, you can find the store that offers "Best" vegetable. The definition of "Best" would depend on you. If you think freshness is the most important, then Cheapest would tell you where you can buy fresh vegetable by listing all the stores sorted by freshness of their vegetables. When distance is your priority and freshness is second factor, Cheapest would help you find the nearest store with fresh vegetables.  Moreover, Cheapest would help you check if the food is available or not and filter the result according to your choice. Cheapest would also estimate the price trend of the food you search according to the recent weather conditions. Enjoy the Cheapest!
