-**Find My Veggies** v1.0.0 - 2016-04-01  
-* **Problem:** Due to the Google free api plan problem, only maximum to 1000 quote can be requested in 24hr, so when querying date for store details, only about 9 store details can be requested.
+**Find My Veggies** v1.1.0 - 2016-04-07  
 
-This is a Web App to help people find fresh and cheap vegetables for Lafayette area.  
+* **Note for chrome users! Firefox and Safari can skip this**  
+	**The page needs to be ran on a local server or real server!**  
+	**If Python is installed on the computer:**  
+	**1. Please open terminal and go to the directory that contain the index.html file**  
+		(i.e: cd Desktop/iron-hack/lostkuma.....)  
+	**2. For Python 3 call: python -m http.server**  
+	**3. For Python 2.7 call: python -m SimpleHTTPServer**  
+	**Then go to http://localhost:8000/**  
+	**Otherwise follow (https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/wiki/How-to-run-things-locally)**  
 
-The App uses Google Map API combined with open datasets to display features for local food markets regarding to vegetables.
-Those features will include but not limited to: freshness, price, open hours, distance, predicted transportation time, parking lot accessibility, customer ratings, service, etc. for a single store. As well as the comparison function over these features for multiple stores.  
+* **Note about Google Map Quota Limitation**  
+	**Request store details will go over quota limit for the free plan users**  
+	**There is a solution, however it will slow down the speed of the page significantly**  
+	**Therefore, I just left it with it's quota capability so that the page loads faster since it's already slow with all that callback functions and stuff**

 **Description**  
 * Datasets   
-Dataets that will be used are listed. However, at this phase not all details of how they will be used are specified.  
-(More datasets will be added later. Existing datasets maybe modified later.)  
 	* Climate Data Online (http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/climate-data-online-cdo)  
-	  Normals Daily Data for Indiana from 3/24/2015 to 3/24/2016  
-	  Columns used: Precipitation, Winds, Daily total sunshine, Maximum temperature, Minimum temperature, Snowfall  
+	  Daily summaeries for Purdue Airport station and West Lafayette station from 2011/1/1 to 2016/1/31  
+	  	* Columns used: Precipitation, Winds, Snow, Maximum temperature, Minimum temperature  
+	  	This is devided up to training set and test set and trained with machine learning in decision tree  
+	* National farmer's market directory (http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/national-farmers-market-directory)   
+	  	* Columns used: Farmer's market open seasons for Lafayette and West Lafayette, IN  
+	  	This is used as factors that can affect freshness monthly  
+	* Surface water data for the nation (http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/usgs-surface-water-data-for-the-nation-national-water-information-system-nwis)  
+	  	* Columns used: surface water for wabash river at lafayette: average daily discharge from 1923/10/1 to 2015/9/30  
+	  	This is used as factors that can affect freshness daily  
+	* Severe weather data (http://catalog.data.gov/dataset/severe-weather-data-inventory)  
+	  	* Columns used: great lafayette area storm and hail reports from 2011/1/1 to 2015/12/31  
+	  	This is used as factors that can affect freshness monthly  
+	---------------- the above datasets are from data.gov ----------------
 	* Seasonal vegetable chart (http://www.cuesa.org/eat-seasonally/charts/vegetables)  
-	  Vegetable names and in season months
+	  	* Vegetable names and in season months  
+	  	This is used as factors that can affect freshness monthly  
 	* Google Store Details data gotten from query (https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/)  
-	  geometry location, place_id, place name, place address, place phone number, place website, place rating, place price level, place open hours
+	  	* Geometry location, place_id, place name, place address, place phone number, place website, place rating, place price level, place open hours  
+	  	Some of this is used as factors that can affect freshness locally  
+	* For more detailed information about how datasets are used see Data Processing
 	
+* Data Processing
+	* Machine learning algorithm was used to process the climate data online datasets in order to get more reasonable prediction on freshness using current weather based on the old climate data  
+	* However, it is very hard for one individual to process a huge amount of data within limited time period, only climate data for lafayette area are taken and trained using decision tree  
+	* Raw climate data for the past 5 years on daily maximum temperatue, minimum temperature, rain, snow, and wind speed are taken and washed combined with month are inported to decision tree in python as training set  
+	* The initial freshness feature are set to zero for all the rows in the dataset, and is calculated in a 1 to 10 scale using feature functions to assign a freshness score for the training set  
+	* After training in python, the decision tree nodes and necessary data points are printed and imported to javascript manually (since there's no need to load the decision tree for training every time when the webpage is loaded) and the decisions are made with javascript predict function (see decisiontree.js)  
+	* The current climate data, gotten from open weather map api, including current day predicted maximum temperature, minimum temperature, rain, snow, and wind speed data are then served as input for the decision tree to predict a current freshness level affected by weather factor  
+	* Other datasets, the farmer's market data, severe weather data, seasonal vegetable data and water discharge data are processed using python. All the processed data is in 1 to 10 scale for easier calculation  
+	* Then each factor that will affect current day's freshness (weather, water, farmer's market, severe weather, in season vegetables) is assigned with a weight to calculate a final freshness score by the environment factors.
+	* Idealy, the restock date and time for the stores and distance from the store to the products provider should be considered as features for calculating individual stores differences. However, these data are nowhere can be found online, so in this case, instead of the ideal situation, store rating and open hours are considered to give the individual differences on freshness level. The assumption is, the longer total weekly open hour is, the more restock times it will be for a single store; and the higher rating it is, the freshier products that the store is selling.
+	* Limitations:
+		* There is no well-defined algorithms for calculting freshness of vegetables yet, the algorithm used in this app mostly based on assumptions and common sense, which might differ from the general facts. More studies on how exactly weather will affect vegetable growth and freshness should be considered for a better algorithm.  
+		* Decision tree might not be the best way for prediction in this case, however due to lots of limitations, no other machine learning algorithm was tested.  
+		* The test dataset, though returned a 100% accuracy on predicting the freshness level, only include 31 data points taken from January 2016 from the same stations. The algorithm need to be tested on more varied datasets from different months, however due to the incompletence of newer and older data, no further testing was done.  
+		* Due to the amount of data that has to be processed and tagged for prediction, only lafayette and west lafayette area's weather data were trained. So this app will only return good predictions (assume the algorithm is well defined) for these areas.  
+		* This algorithm only serve as a template for a reasonable prediction, but cannot be applied generally (unfortunately, there's no correct solusion to determine freshness).

 **Build up information**  
-At this point the project only uses HTML/CSS/Javascript. However, other dependencies might be used in the future. An updated readme file will then be submitted along with later submissions.
+The project only uses HTML/CSS/Javascript. Python was used for data training and transforming, however, the results are printed out and pasted to a javascrpt file to be able to access easier for javascript further calculation.  
 
 **Test**  
-The complete version of this App is exptected to be tested on the following broswers: Chrome, Firefox and Safari
+The App is test in Chrome, Firefox and Safari. The Geolocation function which request the browser's location has to be ran on a local/real server on Chrome to be able to functioning since Chrome seems to block something.  
 
 **Additional information**  
-My interests of study for my Master's program greatly related to Natural Language Processing. So if time allows, I would like to add some NLP stuff to the App as well. For example, information retrival from natural language text that users entered, and other things like text to speech feature using Google or IBM speech to text API. I've made an web app using text to speech API from IBM's Bluemix platform before (http://jsx.mybluemix.net/), but speech to text was a challenge, which remains a difficulty for me who did not have a solid programming background.  
+The decision tree prediction method might not be super well defined, and the dataset for training is probably not big enough for getting a super good result sometimes. Opendata sets data processing, especially the weather data, need to be well understood and defined if to be used in practical application development.  
+  
+The mendatory data set climate online data only contains old data, which is not a very good idea to be used in this case to fit the goal of this application -- find fresh vegetables. Though weather data will influence the freshness of vegetables, it could be combined with seasonal data -- according to vegetables' growing seasons. Since in general, a perticular outlier weather condition is very less likely to appear in a certain season (say snowing in August), weather data in this case could be omit to my personal opinion...  
+  
+The goal of this project, finding fresh and cheap vegetables, is actually very vague due to the definition of freshness. Nowadays, most of the vegetables can be grown in greenhouses and can get on markets all seasons, so freshness.... is just very hard to define. If to follow the old traditions, we won't be able to get anything other than potatos and stuff in winter.... If freshness have to be defined, it should have something to do with the store's stocking time, and how well they keep their products (for example, if they water them, under what temperature, etc.). However, most stores won't release these information online (not necessary, every store have their own expert; or for small stores, they just keep things based on common sense), unless one find a job at like Walmart, but even then, they use machine to control everything.... Even there is a way to access all ussful information, we are going to need an expert in biology to tell us what exactly will a condition affect the freshness of vegetables...
+
+**^ Please ignore all my random imaginations and complains unless you also go after the reasonings behind things like a mad scientist...**  
 
-I will thank my boyfriend Jason Macnak, a former Purdue graduate and a software engineer at Google, for all the supports and additional help I got and will be getting on the project.  
+I will thank my boyfriend Jason Macnak, a former Purdue graduate and a software engineer at Google, for all the mental supports during this project, as well as teaching me all the basics of programming languages patiently for the past couple months...

+//				in training data are calculate with feature functions but feature functions are defined
