 
 Data Visualization:
 
[N] [describe] Use Graph? What is the type? (bar chart, pie chart, radar chart ...)
Although I do not have it implemented right now, I want to have a Freshness Scale which will show the user how fresh the vegetables are on a scale of 1-10. I also want to have a clock which will show the time.
 
[N] [List] Any interaction available on the graph? List them (enable click on numbers, drag on lines, change time/variables ...)
Although I do not have it implemented right now, this is what I want to accomplish: Interaction Form: I want to have a clock in which the user can click on it and drag it to a time, then it will show the user if the market will be open or closed at that time. I have included in my picture what I want the Freshness Scale to look like, a long line with a marker that can be moved back and forth.
 
 [Y] [List] Any information output? list them. (text field, text area, label, plain HTML ...)
I currently have a homepage with a title, description, and a button that takes the user to the map view.
 
 [Y] [List] Any operation option (filters)? List them. (search markets, search vegetables, filter based on price, sort based on convenience ...)
Right now I only have a search button that takes the user to the map view. Eventually, I want to have: Search markets, search vegetables, filter on price, filter on times open/closed, which market is closest.
 
 [Y/N] [List] Any information input? List them. (comments, markers, user preference ...)
 Not sure yet.
 
 [Y] [List] Interaction with Map? List them. (filter on price will affect map markers, sort on price will affect map markers, ...)
Right now the user can move around the map.
 
[N] [List] Interaction with data visualization? List them. (filter, sort, set variables ...)
Not yet.

 Additional information You Want to Share with Us E.g. any problems you faced/fixed, where you reached out to for help, etc.
- I am currently very confused on how to implement the data sets from data.gov. I'm working on figuring out what functions I need, markers I need, datasets I need, etc. This is my first time working with .html so I am coming along very slowly
