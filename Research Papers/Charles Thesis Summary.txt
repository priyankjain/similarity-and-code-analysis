Mashups=> Open Data => Transparency => Make code public => Learn => Reuse

Three kinds of reuse activities:
	1. Greenfield projects: No reuse, therefore truly novel
	2. Cloned projects: Simply copy others code
	3. Augmented projects: Develop novel ideas based on the reuse of other's code 

Reuse in transparent context makes finding unique solutions difficult. Plagiarism detection is therefore required.

Similarity at different levels:
	- Code Similarity
	- Functional Similarity
	- Visual Similarity
Thesis focuses on functional similarity and visual similarity
